ugly website

STAGE I:
(1/25/13)
Single page layout with four things to look at-- home, about, photo, paint.
I have gotten feedback that the single page layout is annoying because it is second nature to use backspace to return to previous.
I may consider changing this.
Other notes: I need to find a decent plugin for the gallery pages.
